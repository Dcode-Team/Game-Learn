Our project is a learning web site that is directed to kids between the age of 4 to 7 for learning english as a second language.Our web site presents kids with three games, each game with a different target that catches a particular aspect of the English language.

 In our project we tried incorporating a lot of catching styles and images, sounds and fun  games that would attract the kid's attention and make them engage in a fun learning experience. The structure of our web page contains four major pages. The first page is the intro page, that will introduce our visitors with a short description of our website and tells a brief paragraph of our vision and of what this website will hopefully achieve.  The second component of the page is three major buttons that will take the kid to each game. 

 * The first game is called  **(letters and numbers)**  it’s aim to teach kids the English letters and numbers. When the kid presses the big button on the home screen it will lead our little friend to a page full of numbers and letters listed randomly and when clicking  on any random number or letter. A sound of pop out introducing the kid of the number or letter he/she clicked on.


* The second game is called **(animales)** when clicked on the button featuring animals on the home screen page, it will lead the kid to a page full of interactive images of different animals with sounds of these animals popping out whenever clicked on one of these images. Under each image there are multiple choices of different animals and the kid is responsible to choose the correct name of the animal image. At the button of the page there is the score that would tell the kid of how many correct answers he/she answered and it will be saved each time the kid plays this game to measure his/her improvement. 


 * The third and final game is a little advanced one. it is a **quiz**. It will be a couple of questions aimed to measure the kid’s information about what he/she learned about from the two previous games. 


The last page will be a creator's page, where there is a previous description and pictures of the creators of this learning and playing game.
